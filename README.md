# Self-lacing Shoe

My final project for Swartzendruber's Digital Electronics class in 2019, built w/ Skyler Cleland (https://github.com/killerskyman).
It's a shoe that ties itself.

## Licensing information

This project conforms to a BSD 3-clause license with an additional clause, discussed in more detail in the LICENSE file.
Basically, you may *never* use this for a PLTW project, including Digital Electronics & EDD.

## Building

The file `main.ino` is openable by the Arduino IDE.
If you're me, and extremely eccentric, you can use the `build` script with some modifications in conjunction with `arduino-builder`.
If you want to do that, the script should be self-explanatory.

## CAD/PCB

The CAD for this is developed in Autodesk Inventor.
The PCB files are developed in Autodesk EAGLE.
